LUDIC Arcade is an MA project created out of research on how to think about and develop inclusive and transgressive spaces that make videogames more approachable for members of the community who do not identify as being a part of gaming culture. How can we foster conversations of the legitimacy of gamer culture? And how do we make spaces for people to consider themselves as not gamers, but rather, just players?
