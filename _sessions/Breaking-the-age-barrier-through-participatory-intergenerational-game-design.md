Older adults are often excluded of the game design process in the game industry (De Schutter, 2010). Moreover, the representation of older adults in game reflects stereotypes which not represents the diversity of this population. From a critical play perspective, we consider games as social, cultural and political objects (Flanagan, 2009). In order to improve games inclusiveness, we propose to engage older adults not only as end-users but as creators within an intergenerational game design process. We discuss the opportunities of guiding the participatory intergenerational game design using the gerontoludic manifesto proposed by De Schutter and Abeele (2015).
