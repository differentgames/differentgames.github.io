Using a participatory action framework, the research team spent four months brain storming, designing, and producing a game that addressed issues encountered by those in the LGBTQIA+ community. Lead researcher Nathan Thompson will be joined by indie game developer, Chad Comeau and some of the projectâ€™s youth participants in order to reveal and discuss the game they created. They will also reflect on the process of participatory video game production, its potential for generating community engagement, and the impact the game had on those who have played it.
